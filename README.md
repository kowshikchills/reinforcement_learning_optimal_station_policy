# Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Station Policy

## Problem Statement

1. Suppose you are in a SQUARE playground and a BALL pops up RANDOMLY (but uniformly) in the playground . Your job is to collect the ball and ‘’Wait For The Next Ball’’ to pop up.

 2. The next ball pops up after a fixed waiting time only after you collect the one on the ground.

 3. This ball collecting game runs till the time is out.

 4. More the balls you collect, more the reward you get at the end of game.
>  **Problem:** what would you do in the ‘waiting time’ in order to quickly collect the next balls that can pop anywhere in the ground. Assume that the waiting time is enough to circle the square ground once.

## How to Run 


1. Make sure you have all the dependecies required with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`(its reconmended to run in an virtual environment.)

3. Run `streamlit run main.py`
